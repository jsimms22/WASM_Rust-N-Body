First time set-up for up your local environment step-by-step:

1) Ensure the Rust application can build independently without errors
    
    ```$ cargo build```
    
2) Add a useful taraget for your build
    
    ```$ rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown```
    
3) Build the Rust application to the target that was just added
    
    ```$ cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release```

4) Install the wasm-bindgen-cli command-line application
    
    ```$ cargo install -f wasm-bindgen-cli```

5) Now we can take our WebAssembly code generated by Rust and create a wrapping for the React application
    
    ```$ wasm-bindgen target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/rusty_react.wasm --out-dir build```


To build the Rust, WebAssembly, and JavaScript:
    
   ```$ npm run build```

Hosting a Local Server
    
   ```$ npm run dev```

Scripts Embedded in Package.json
    
    "dev": "webpack server",
    "build:wasm": "cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown",
    "build:bindgen": "wasm-bindgen target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/debug/nbody_wasm.wasm --out-dir build",
    "build": "npm run build:wasm && npm run build:bindgen && npx webpack"

Note: if there is an error building the stdweb crate when building the wasm binary, make sure wasm-webpack is installed

    ```$ npm install wasm-pack```
